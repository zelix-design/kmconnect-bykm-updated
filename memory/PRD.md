# FinFlow — Product Requirements Document

**Problem statement (original):** "I want to build a financial management system very user friendly"

## User choices (verbatim)
- Small business (invoicing, expenses, clients)
- Income & expense tracking with categories
- Multiple accounts (bank, cash, credit card)
- JWT-based custom auth (email + password)
- No AI, keep it simple
- USD default, INR option

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB async). Single `server.py` with `/api` router. JWT (HS256) in httpOnly cookie + Bearer fallback. bcrypt password hashing.
- **Frontend**: React 19 + react-router 7. Shadcn UI + Tailwind (custom stone/emerald/rose palette). Phosphor icons. Recharts. Sonner toasts.
- **Storage**: MongoDB collections — `users`, `accounts`, `clients`, `categories`, `transactions`, `invoices`. UUID `id` field for all docs.

## User personas
- Small business owner managing invoices, clients, and accounts.
- Solo founder/freelancer logging income & expenses.

## Core requirements (static)
- Email/password auth, persistent session via httpOnly cookie
- Per-user data isolation
- CRUD for accounts, clients, categories, transactions, invoices
- Dashboard: total balance, monthly income/expense, outstanding invoices, 6-month cash flow, expense-by-category breakdown
- Multi-currency formatting (USD/INR) via Intl.NumberFormat
- Default seed: 10 categories + 1 "Main Bank" account on user creation

## Implementation status — 2026-02-14 (MVP complete)
- [x] Backend: full API surface (auth, accounts, clients, categories, transactions, invoices, dashboard)
- [x] Admin seed user `admin@finflow.com / Admin@123`
- [x] Frontend: login/register, sidebar shell, dashboard, transactions, accounts, invoices, clients, categories, settings
- [x] Currency switcher (USD/INR)
- [x] Recharts bar (cash flow) + pie (expense breakdown)
- [x] 100% backend (17/17 pytest) + 100% frontend (Playwright E2E) — see /app/test_reports/iteration_1.json

## Implementation status — 2026-02-14 (iteration 2)
- [x] Invoice PDF export per-row (client-side jsPDF + autotable)
- [x] Dashboard date-range filter (This month / Last 30d / Last 90d / YTD / Custom)
- [x] Quick Entry page (`/quick-entry`): debit/credit mode toggle, keypad, category chips, "Other (Specify)" input
- [x] New default expense categories seeded + backfilled for existing users: Rent, Fuel Exp, Toll, Cab Exp, Train/Bus Booking, Food, Other
- [x] 100% (24/24 backend + Playwright E2E) — see /app/test_reports/iteration_2.json

## Prioritized backlog
**P1**
- Brute-force lockout on login (5-fail → 15 min) per auth playbook
- Invoice PDF export / share link
- Recurring transactions & bill reminders
- Dashboard date-range filter (this month / last 90d / custom)

**P2**
- Real-time bank import (CSV upload)
- Tax reports (quarterly summary)
- Multi-user / team roles
- Production CORS allowlist + Secure=True cookie

**Polish**
- Add DialogDescription to all dialogs (a11y)
- Recharts ResponsiveContainer minHeight (silence console warning)
- True partial PATCH for accounts/invoices
- Cascade/block on account delete when referenced by transactions
